## How Can I Contribute?

### Before Submitting An Issue

#### Read the docs

If you just have a question, you'll get faster results by checking the [FAQs for a list of common questions and problems](https://theme-next.js.org/docs/faqs) or the [troubleshooting part of «NexT» Documentation Site](https://theme-next.js.org/docs/troubleshooting).

Also, you can perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/next-theme/hexo-theme-next/search?q=&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93) to see if the problem has already been reported or solved. You don't want to duplicate effort. You might be able to find the cause of the problem and fix things yourself, or add comments to the existed issue.

#### Quick debug instructions

Before submitting an Issue on GitHub, you can follow our [Quick debug instructions](https://theme-next.js.org/docs/troubleshooting.html#Quick-Debug-Instructions) to debug.

If you find a bug in the source code, most importantly, please check carefully if you can reproduce the problem [in the latest release version of NexT](https://github.com/next-theme/hexo-theme-next/releases/latest). Then, you can help us by [Reporting Bugs](#reporting-bugs) or [Suggesting Enhancements](#suggesting-enhancements) to our [Repository](https://github.com/next-theme/hexo-theme-next). Even better, you can [submit a Pull Request](#submitting-a-pull-request) with a fix.

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-issue) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When creating an issue, following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports:

* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
* Provide the information as many details as possible by filling in [the required template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).
* Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. When listing steps, don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it, e.g. which command exactly you used. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/) or [a permanent link to a code snippet](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-permanent-link-to-a-code-snippet/), or a [Gist link](https://gist.github.com/).
* Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files (screenshots or GIFs) or live demo.
* Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.

#### Reporting Security Bugs

If you find a security issue, please act responsibly and report it not in the public issue tracker, but directly to us, so we can fix it before it can be exploited. Please send the related information to security@theme-next.com (desirable with using PGP for e-mail encryption).

We will gladly special thanks to anyone who reports a vulnerability so that we can fix it. If you want to remain anonymous or pseudonymous instead, please let us know that; we will gladly respect your wishes.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-issue) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. After you've determined the repository your enhancement suggestion is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the information as many details as possible by filling in [the required template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions.

* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most users.
* Provide specific examples to demonstrate the suggestion. Include links to files (screenshots or GIFs) or live demo.

### Submitting a Pull Request

Before creating a Pull Request (PR), please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-issue) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. After you've determined the repository your pull request is related to, create a pull request on that repository. The detailed document of creating a pull request can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your pull request :pencil::

* Follow our [Coding Rules](#coding-rules) and [commit message conventions](#commit-messages-rules).
* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the pull request. Do not include issue numbers in the PR title.
* Fill in [the required template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) as many details as possible.
* All features or bug fixes must be tested in all schemes. And provide specific examples to demonstrate the pull request. Include links to files (screenshots or GIFs) or live demo.

### Creating Releases

Releases are a great way to ship projects on GitHub to your users.

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository. Under your repository name, click **Releases**. Click **Draft a new release**.
2. Type a version number for your release. Versions are based on [Git tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging). We recommend naming tags that fit within [About Major and Minor NexT versions](https://github.com/theme-next/hexo-theme-next/issues/187).
3. Select a branch that contains the project you want to release. Usually, you'll want to release against your `master` branch, unless you're releasing beta software.
4. Type a title and description that describes your release.
    - Use the version as the title.
    - The content should be filled in according to the template of the [Release Drafter](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter).
    - Use the passive tense and subject-less sentences.
    - All changes must be documented in release notes. If commits happen without pull request (minimal changes), just add this commit ID into release notes. If commits happen within pull request alreay, just add the related pull request ID including all possible commits.
5. If you'd like to include binary files along with your release, such as compiled programs, drag and drop or select files manually in the binaries box.
6. If the release is unstable, select **This is a pre-release** to notify users that it's not ready for production. If you're ready to publicize your release, click **Publish release**. Otherwise, click **Save draft** to work on it later.

### Commit Messages Rules

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. Each commit message consists of a `type` and a `subject`. This leads to more
readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history.

- `type` describes the meaning of this commit including but not limited to the following items, and capitalize the first letter.
    * `Build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
    * `Ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
    * `Docs`: Documentation only changes
    * `Feat`: A new feature
    * `Fix`: A bug fix
    * `Perf`: A code change that improves performance
    * `Refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
    * `Style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
    * `Revert`: Revert some existing commits
    * `Release`: Commit a release for a conventional changelog project
- The `subject` contains a succinct description of the change, like `Update code highlighting in README.md`.
    * No dot (.) at the end.
    * Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
